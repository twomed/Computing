Assignment 1/31
I am going to start out by introducing the concept of variable assignment. This is how variables get the data they are "pointed" to.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a=2
b=3
c=a*b
print(c)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once again we can run the type on variable and the return will by the type of the data they are assigned.

This is fine if we want to use python as a calculator. But let us take a closer look at strings.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

name = 'Travis Miller'

first = name[0:6]

last = name[7:]

middle = 'Neal'

name = first + ' ' + middle + ' ' + last

print(name)

print('wow'*3)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that once reassigned the variable name has no access to what is used to be assigned to. This can be very helpful with that are called recursive functions but we have to be sure we only want an endpoint and not all of the steps. %recursive

Take the two variables below an create a new variable named child using a mesh of their two names.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
husband = 'Andy Sweet'

wife = 'Nancy Rainwater'
