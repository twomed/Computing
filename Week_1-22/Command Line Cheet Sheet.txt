In the command line or terminal we have the ability to do a lot of things that would take entire applications. An example of this is updating the version of python we are using. This is a huge pain in the GUI(Graphical User Interface) application "Software Manager". While this is one command in the terminal.

Vocab:
Directory - What most people call a folder
Root - Where the users files are stored. (Not operating system files)
Command - The operation we want to preform
Options or locations we are calling the command on. Denoted below by []


So far we have looked at select few commands:

List all files and directories
in current directory:              ls
Change Directory:                  cd [The directory we want to change into]
Go up a Directory:                 cd ..
Go to root directory               cd -
Make a Directory:                  mkdir [name_of_new_folder]
Make a file:                       touch [name_of_new_file]
