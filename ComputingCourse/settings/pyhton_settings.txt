NOT TO BE USED YET NOT READY WE WILL GET HERE SOON


You will need to following to configure python in linux mint.


sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade

Then once that has run:


sudo apt-get install python3.6

The idea here is we want to be using the new python 3.6 and not legacy python
or python 2.7.


echo alias python=python3 >> ~/.bashrc

The run:

source ~/.bashrc



Test your new python:

python --version

sudo apt-get install python3-pip
